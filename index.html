<h1>My Profile</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is John Rosales and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised here in Melbourne, Australia and I have a Filipino background however my only spoken language is English. I recently graduated from Australian Catholic University with a Diploma of Nursing last August 2021. While I enjoyed my course for the most part, I knew by the end of the degree that it was not the career path which I thought I could pursue for the rest of my life. Through time and reflection, I thought that I should pursue what I have always been interested in – computers and technology. </p>
<p>From a young age I was introduced to technology such as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS and to this day, are still platforms which I still play. Currently I am playing Destiny 2 on the Playstation 5, Overwatch and Minecraft doing usual Minecraft things. Since I have had to travel back into the city for Uni, I have been getting back into Pokemon games such as Legends: Arceus and Brilliant Diamond on the Nintendo Switch to kill the travel time. Other than games, I follow sports regularly with AFL and the NBA being the sports I follow the most.</p>
<p>My interest particularly peaked in 2020 during the COVID lockdown when I considered buying a gaming PC. During this time, I was watching PC construction builds and learning about the different parts which make up a PC and how to assemble one. However due to my nursing commitments at the time, I sadly did not end up pursing a gaming PC but hopefully in the near future I may attempt to build one myself again.<p>
<p>I chose to study here at RMIT because of the reputation associated with this University in terms of high quality of education for technology courses and the modern facilities available to students. Currently, I have a very limited knowledge of IT technology in terms of the extensive programming and development involved in the use of computer programs and hardware. As such my goal at the end of this course is the to be able to have the skills and knowledge to be able to perform a wide range of IT related skills, so that I may be able to enter the IT workforce prepared.<p>
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<h2>What makes this position appealing</h2>
<p>The position of being an IT Support Technician is appealing as it allows me to work in diverse scenarios. Not having to solve the same problem every day of the week will ensure that I am always engaged in my work. IT Support does not apply to one single company or business, it’s a position which is desired by any and every company and business around the city, state or country. As such, being able to leave one employer and join another is an aspect which I find may be exciting if I feel like working in a different environment if I wanted to.<p>
<h2>Skills qualifications and experience required for the position</h2>
<p>The position requires skills in troubleshooting Microsoft Windows, 365, Office and Apple programs along with skills and knowledge of networking. Usual personality skills are also required with effective communication with clients being a required skill and being able to manage a broad range of clients.<p>
<h2>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</h2>
<p>As it stands, I currently have no advanced IT experience in terms of networking or programming, other than the current skills which I am learning in University. Apart from this, I consider myself very proficient with the core computer programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Generally speaking, I am used to setting up devices such as Internet Modems, Routers and Printers.<p>
<h2>Plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h2>
<p>As I would be expected to be able to troubleshoot a wide range of IT problems, the subjects I will need to study must be able to teach me how to solve such range of problems. I would need solidify my understanding of Programming and perhaps go a step further and complete the Programming 1 subject. Once I further advance in my degree, subjects such as Unix System Admin/Programming is a subject I would need to study, as well as Security in Comp/IT.<p>
