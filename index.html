<h1 style= "position:relative; left:84px;">My Profile</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is John Rosales and I am 21 years old. I was born and raised here in Melbourne, Australia and I have a Filipino background however my only spoken language is English. I recently graduated from Australian Catholic University with a Diploma of Nursing last August 2021. While I enjoyed my course for the most part, I knew by the end of the degree that it was not the career path which I thought I could pursue for the rest of my life. Through time and reflection, I thought that I should pursue what I have always been interested in – computers and technology. </p>
<p>From a young age I was introduced to technology such as the Playstation 2 and Nintendo DS and to this day, are still platforms which I still play. Currently I am playing Destiny 2 on the Playstation 5, Overwatch and Minecraft doing usual Minecraft things. Since I have had to travel back into the city for Uni, I have been getting back into Pokemon games such as Legends: Arceus and Brilliant Diamond on the Nintendo Switch to kill the travel time. Other than games, I follow sports regularly with AFL and the NBA being the sports I follow the most.</p>

<p>My interest particularly peaked in 2020 during the COVID lockdown when I considered buying a gaming PC. During this time, I was watching PC construction builds and learning about the different parts which make up a PC and how to assemble one. However due to my nursing commitments at the time, I sadly did not end up pursing a gaming PC but hopefully in the near future I may attempt to build one myself again.</p>
<p>I chose to study here at RMIT because of the reputation associated with this University in terms of high quality of education for technology courses and the modern facilities available to students. Currently, I have a very limited knowledge of IT technology in terms of the extensive programming and development involved in the use of computer programs and hardware. As such my goal at the end of this course is the to be able to have the skills and knowledge to be able to perform a wide range of IT related skills, so that I may be able to enter the IT workforce prepared.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<img src="seek.jpg" alt width="400" height="250"
style="float:right;/* text-align: right; */">
<h2>What makes this position appealing</h2>
<p>The position of being an IT Support Technician is appealing as it allows me to work in diverse scenarios. Not having to solve the same problem every day of the week will ensure that I am always engaged in my work. IT Support does not apply to one single company or business, it’s a position which is desired by any and every company and business around the city, state or country. As such, being able to leave one employer and join another is an aspect which I find may be exciting if I feel like working in a different environment if I wanted to.</p>

<h2>Skills qualifications and experience required for the position</h2>
<p>The position requires skills in troubleshooting Microsoft Windows, 365, Office and Apple programs along with skills and knowledge of networking. Usual personality skills are also required with effective communication with clients being a required skill and being able to manage a broad range of clients.</p>

<h2>Skills, qualifications and experience I currently have</h2>
<p>As it stands, I currently have no advanced IT experience in terms of networking or programming, other than the current skills which I am learning in University. Apart from this, I consider myself very proficient with the core computer programs such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook. Generally speaking, I am used to setting up devices such as Internet Modems, Routers and
Printers.</p>

<h2>Plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h2>
<p>As I would be expected to be able to troubleshoot a wide range of IT problems, the subjects I will need to study must be able to teach me how to solve such range of problems. I would need solidify my understanding of Programming and perhaps go a step further and complete the Programming 1 subject. Once I further advance in my degree, subjects such as Unix System Admin/Programming is a subject I would need to study, as well as Security in Comp/IT.</p>

<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
<p>These results show that I may not be able to work strongly independently. However, in a team setting, I would be able to work more effectively with a support system around me.  Initially, I would honestly consider myself introverted as shown in the first test. But after becoming more settled and accustomed with my peers, I can become more active and talkative. With a peer-support system, I believe it helps unlock my critical-thinking process and allows me to complete my work more efficiently.</p>

<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>These results would indicate that I would work best in a team and collaborate effectively. On some occasions, I find it difficult to plan or develop creative ideas and solutions to a problem. However, I find it easier to develop my plans when my peers give me feedback or expand on my work or vice versa. This is reflected in the third test which states my “creativity is a work in progress.” I believe the third test accurately depicts my ability in a group setting as I would consider myself a person who works better in a collaborative setting.</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I believe these results would allow me to work effectively in a team. Whether or not my idea is the project lead or a team member’s idea is the project lead, I believe I can contribute regularly and effectively.</p>

<h1>My Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>For my project, I would like to develop a training program for Deli employees at Coles Supermarkets. Context for this project is derived from my current part-time job as a Deli employee at Coles. As a Deli team member, the core duty is to weigh items such as hams, salami, seafood and more and input a code on the scales to print out a ticket which labels the product name, price, weight and use-by date. The program I will develop will take shape in the form of a mini game, where a Deli item will appear on the screen and the user will need to enter the corresponding “PLU” (Price Look-up Code).</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>My motivation for this project stemmed from the recent surge in online orders in the past two years, mostly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Surges in orders meant more items being required to prepare and pack, while also simultaneously serving face-to-face customers and performing infection control and hygiene duties. As a result, online orders began to increase, so did the number of items required to be prepared. To further compound the issue, new team members were recently hired which meant inexperienced workers and slow packing time.</p>

<p>One correlation is due to the lack of knowledge of PLU (Price Look Up) codes which are displayed at the back of price tickets. Due to the large volume of items on offer, it is understandably difficult to memorise as many as possible, however I find that it affects efficiency and time. In my own trial which I conducted with my co-workers consent, it takes approximately 14 seconds to look-up an item, weigh the item, print the label and wrap the item compared to approximately 6 seconds to repeat the same process without having to look-up the item. This can also be applied to face-to-face service where wait times may be reduced through training.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The main goals for this product is to provide quick and easy knowledge tests which are both informative and informal. Many of the Coles training programs are very formal and basic by design and function, which can make training tasks very unengaging and in many instances, are never completed due to how boring they are and the way employees feel they are “forced” to complete them.</p>

<p>My training program aims to be both informative but also engaging as if employees are playing a mobile game rather than a training module. The program will open with a table which breaks down the Deli department into different categories such as Salami, Cheese, Ham, Smallgoods (Bacons and Frankfurts), Poultry and Seafood. Each category will have a list of every single item being sold with its corresponding PLU code beside it. Once employees begin the program, they will no longer have access to the table and will have to recall as many PLU codes as possible.</p>

<p>Questions will simply be stated as “What is the PLU for Honey Ham?” An image of the product will also be on the screen with a text box underneath to type the corresponding PLU code for the item. If incorrect, it will state that the answer was “Incorrect! The answer is ____.” I’d plan for the screen background to go red for an incorrect answer and green for correct, similar to the Kahoot quiz design. With further studies and practice, I would also like to add sound cues to correspond to the answers whether they are correct or incorrect.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<img src="pyt.jpg" alt width="550" height="250p" style="position:relative; left:300px;">
<p>Currently, I am using Python program on the website Trinket. Access to Trinket which is given by the university, has allowed me to use the skills and knowledge taught by my lecturers and in the modules from the Introduction to Programming subject. While the coding is very basic, ideally I would like to expand the code to include multiple choice questions and sound cues for correct and incorrect answers.</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>As a first year IT student with no experience in the field, I would need to further my skills and understanding in Python programming. In an ideal scenario, I would like to further expand my training program to feature other Deli aspects such as infection control and multiple-choice commands. From my understanding, there are methods of coding which allows repeats of the current code I am currently using without copying and pasting the same code. This is a skill which I have not learned yet but hopefully I can work on it in the future. This is so that employees won’t feel like they’re being forced to complete this program necessary for work, but more like a fun and interactive program which will assist their learning.</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If this program is successful, ideally online order completions will see a decrease in wait times. With the program’s mini-game nature rather than a training module, hopefully employees may revisit the program multiple times so that it may even be a brain-teaser challenge for them. Additionally, it would also improve wait times for customers who are ordering in-store and work efficiency for the employees who are taking orders.</p>
